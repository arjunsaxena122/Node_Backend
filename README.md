#Project Title: Node_Backend


#Description :-

This project is a full-featured backend application developed using Node.js and Express. It incorporates a variety of technologies and libraries to provide robust authentication, data handling, and additional functionalities. The key components of this project are detailed below:

#Features:-

1. Node.js & Express: The core framework for building the backend server, handling HTTP requests, and routing.

2. MongoDB & Mongoose: MongoDB is used as the database, and Mongoose provides a schema-based solution to model the application data.

3. Authentication: Implemented user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token) to ensure secure access to the application.

4. Data Validation: Used Zod for schema validation to ensure data integrity and validation.

5. Password Hashing: Utilized bcrypt for hashing user passwords to enhance security.

6. File Uploads: Integrated Cloudinary for storing and managing user-uploaded images.

7. OTP Generation: Implemented OTP (One-Time Password) generation using otp-generator for features like two-factor authentication.

8. Email Service: Used NodeMailer to send emails, such as account verification, password reset, and notifications.

#Technologies Used :-
 
a) Node.js: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.

b) Express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

c) MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data.

d) Mongoose: Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.

e) Zod: TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.

f) bcrypt: Password hashing library to enhance security.

g) JSON Web Token (JWT): Token-based authentication.

h) Cloudinary: Cloud-based image and video management service.

i) otp-generator: Library for generating one-time passwords (OTPs).

j) NodeMailer: Module for sending emails from Node.js applications.
